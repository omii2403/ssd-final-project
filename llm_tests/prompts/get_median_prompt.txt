You are an automated test-generator. I will give you a function name, its Python signature, and a short plain-English specification.
Produce a pytest test file that checks the function for correctness and tries to find subtle bugs.
Requirements:
- Only output a Python pytest file (no prose).
- Import the function from module named `target`, e.g. `from target import get_median`.  
- Provide 8-12 deterministic test cases.
- Include edge cases, typical cases, and boundary values.
- Tests must be runnable with pytest.

Function name: get_median
Signature: def get_median(arr1, arr2, n)
Spec: get_median(arr1, arr2, n) takes two sorted lists arr1 and arr2 of equal length n and returns the median of the combined sorted array formed by merging arr1 and arr2.
Example: For arr1 = [1, 12, 15, 26, 38] and arr2 = [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], the combined sorted array is [1, 2, 12, 13, 15, 17, 26, 30, 38, 45], and the median is (15 + 17) / 2 = 16.0.
