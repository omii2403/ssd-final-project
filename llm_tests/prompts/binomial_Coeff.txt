You are an automated test-generator. I will give you a function name, its Python signature, and a short plain-English specification.
Produce a pytest test file that checks the function for correctness and tries to find subtle bugs.
Requirements:
- Only output a Python pytest file (no prose).
- Import the function from module named `target`, e.g. `from target import binomial_Coeff, sum_Of_product`.
- Provide 6-12 deterministic test cases.
- Include edge cases, typical cases, and boundary values.
- Tests must be runnable with pytest.

Function name: binomial_Coeff and sum_Of_product
Signature: 
def binomial_Coeff(n: int, k: int) -> int
def sum_Of_product(n: int) -> int

Spec: binomial_Coeff(n, k) computes the binomial coefficient C(n, k), which represents the number of ways to choose k items from n items. It uses dynamic programming based on Pascal's triangle. The function returns an integer.
sum_Of_product(n) computes C(2n, n-1), which is the binomial coefficient of 2n choose n-1.

Mathematical properties:
- C(n, 0) = 1 and C(n, n) = 1 for all n >= 0
- C(n, k) = C(n, n-k) (symmetry property)
- C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k) (Pascal's identity)
- Sum of row n: C(n, 0) + C(n, 1) + ... + C(n, n) = 2^n

Example: binomial_Coeff(5, 2) -> 10
Example: binomial_Coeff(6, 3) -> 20
Example: binomial_Coeff(4, 2) -> 6
Example: sum_Of_product(3) -> 15 (which is C(6, 2))
Example: sum_Of_product(4) -> 56 (which is C(8, 3))

Constraints: n >= 0, 0 <= k <= n for binomial_Coeff; n >= 1 for sum_Of_product
