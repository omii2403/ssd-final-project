You are an automated test-generator. I will give you a function name, its Python signature, and a short plain-English specification.
Produce a pytest test file that checks the function for correctness and tries to find subtle bugs.
Requirements:
- Only output a Python pytest file (no prose).
- Import the function from module named `target`, e.g. `from target import max_run_uppercase`.    
- Provide 6-12 deterministic test cases.
- Include edge cases, typical cases, and boundary values.
- Tests must be runnable with pytest.

Function name: max_run_uppercase
Signature: max_run_uppercase(test_str)   
Spec: "max_run_uppercase python function to find the sum of even factors of a number. The function takes a positive integer n as input and returns the sum of all its even factors."   
"constraints": "test_str is a non-empty string containing alphabetic characters.",
    "example": {
        "input": "aaAAABBBccDDDDDeE",
        "output": 5
