You are an automated test-generator. I will give you a function name, its Python signature, and a short plain-English specification.
Produce a pytest test file that checks the function for correctness and tries to find subtle bugs.
Requirements:
- Only output a Python pytest file (no prose).
- Import the function from module named `target`, e.g. `from target import Pair, max_chain_length`.
- Provide 10-15 deterministic test cases.
- Include edge cases, typical cases, and boundary values.
- Tests must be runnable with pytest.

Function name: longest_increasing_subsequence
Signature: 
def longest_increasing_subsequence(arr: List[int]) -> int

Spec: longest_increasing_subsequence(arr) takes a list of integers arr and returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in arr using dynamic programming.
Example: longest_increasing_subsequence([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) should return 6 because the LIS is [10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80].
Constraints: n >= 1
