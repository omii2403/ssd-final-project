You are an automated test-generator. I will give you a function name, its Python signature, and a short plain-English specification.

Produce a pytest test file that checks the function for correctness and tries to find subtle bugs.

Requirements:
- Only output a Python pytest file (no prose).
- Import the function from module named target, e.g. from target import get_max_gold.
- Provide 6-12 deterministic test cases.
- Include edge cases, typical cases, and boundary values.
- Tests must be runnable with pytest.

Function name: sum_of_odd_Factors

Signature:
def sum_of_odd_Factors(n: int) -> int

Spec:
sum_of_odd_Factors(n) returns the sum of all **odd** positive factors of n.  
Examples:  
sum_of_odd_Factors(12) → odd factors are {1,3} → returns 4  
sum_of_odd_Factors(21) → odd factors are {1,3,7,21} → returns 32  
Constraints: n is a positive integer.
