You are an automated test-generator. I will give you a function name, its Python signature, and a short plain-English specification.
Produce a pytest test file that checks the function for correctness and tries to find subtle bugs.
Requirements:
- Only output a Python pytest file (no prose).
- Import the function from module named `target`, e.g. `from target import count_Pairs`.
- Provide 6-12 deterministic test cases.
- Include edge cases, typical cases, and boundary values.
- Tests must be runnable with pytest.

Function name: count_Pairs  
Signature: def count_Pairs(arr: list, n: int) -> int  
Spec: count_Pairs(arr, n) takes a list of integers 'arr' and its length 'n', and returns the number of pairs of equal elements in the list. A pair is defined as two indices (i, j) such that arr[i] == arr[j] and i < j.
Example:  For arr = [1, 1, 1, 1] and n = 4, the function should return 6, as there are 6 pairs of equal elements: (1,1) at indices (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3), and (2,3).
Constraints: arr is a list of integers, and n is the length of the list.
