You are an automated test-generator. I will give you a function name, its Python signature, and a short plain-English specification.
Produce a pytest test file that checks the function for correctness and tries to find subtle bugs.
Requirements:
- Only output a Python pytest file (no prose).
- Import the function from module named `target`, e.g. `from target import find_max_val`.  
- Provide 6-12 deterministic test cases.
- Include edge cases, typical cases, and boundary values.
- Tests must be runnable with pytest.

Function name: find_max_val
Signature: find_max_val(n, x, y):  -> int 
Spec: "find_max_valpython function to find the sum of even factors of a number. The function takes a positive integer n as input and returns the sum of all its even factors." 
Example:" "example": "For example, find_max_val(15, 10, 5) returns 15 since 15 % 10 = 5.",
 "constraints": "n, x, and y are integers with n >= 0, x > 0, and 0 <= y < x.",
