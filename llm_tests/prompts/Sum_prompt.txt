You are an automated test-generator. I will give you a function name, its Python signature, and a short plain-English specification.
Produce a pytest test file that checks the function for correctness and tries to find subtle bugs.
Requirements:
- Only output a Python pytest file (no prose).
- Import the function from module named `target`, e.g. `from target import Sum`.  
- Provide 8-12 deterministic test cases.
- Include edge cases, typical cases, and boundary values.
- Tests must be runnable with pytest.

Function name: Sum
Signature: def Sum(N: int) -> int
Spec: "Sum(N) takes a positive integer N and returns the sum of all prime divisors of N."
Example: "For N = 60, the output should be 10",
"constraints": "N is a positive integer",
