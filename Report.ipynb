    "\n",
    "### Where LLM tests tended to **succeed**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Systematic/templated edge cases and common off-by-one errors.**\n",
    "  Examples: `count_duplic`, `get_sum`, `max_sub_array_sum`, `count_Pairs`, `generate_matrix`. These bugs are often revealed by small, mechanical edge tests (zero, one, two, exact-square, equal-values) - LLM test generators often include such cases automatically.\n",
    "* **Simple arithmetic and indexing boundary checks.**\n",
    "  LLMs found many faults that manifest with clear numerical boundaries or obvious loop limits.\n",
    "* **Regular/structured problems where many known test patterns exist.**\n",
    "  Algorithms with well-known failure modes (e.g., DP index updates, divisor loops) were frequently covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why LLM failed sometimes**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Missed subtle semantic conditions or rare invariants.**\n",
    "  Missed `find_Max` (>= vs > in recursion) and `first_Digit` (loop stopping at 10) - these require thinking about exact mathematical invariants or particular small exceptions.\n",
    "* **Errors that require understanding algorithmic intent or path-sensitive reasoning.**\n",
    "  Example: `sum_Of_Primes` and `sum_of_odd_Factors` — deciding whether to include the `p * p == n` case or how to handle the last prime factor needs human-like reasoning about number theory edge cases.\n",
    "* **Logic that depends on contextual ordering or non-obvious preconditions.**\n",
    "  `sort_by_dnf` (mid += 2 bug) — a very specific mutation that a general test generator may not provoke without a tailored input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where Human tests tended to **succeed**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Non-trivial algorithmic invariants or conceptual conditions.**\n",
    "  Humans found `find_Max`, `first_Digit`, `sum_Of_Primes`, `sum_of_odd_Factors`, `sort_by_dnf` — these require insight into the algorithm's intended mathematics or the rare edge-case behaviors that are easy to reason about but less likely to be produced randomly.\n",
    "* **Ad hoc corner cases gleaned from reading the code.**\n",
    "  Humans reading the code can target inputs that exercise particular branches (e.g., exact power-of-two, `n=2` special-case, equal elements in rotated arrays).\n",
    "* **Semantic/intent bugs (wrong operator, wrong formula, wrong parameter).**\n",
    "  Humans are good at seeing \"this line looks suspicious\" and crafting an input to expose it (e.g., wrong binomial parameters, wrong hue offset in `rgb_to_hsv`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Humans failed sometimes**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Limited test breadth and repetition.**\n",
    "  Humans missed systematic patterns that require many variant inputs to expose (e.g., some indexing loops, lots of permutations).\n",
    "* **Human oversight and fatigue.**\n",
    "  Some mechanical off-by-one or many quickly-exercised edge cases were missed because humans don't exhaustively enumerate cases.\n",
    "* **Some misses on randomized or combinatorial inputs.**\n",
    "  LLM-generated suites sometimes covered more combinations than a human would hand-write in the same time.\n"
